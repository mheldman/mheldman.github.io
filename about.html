        <h3>Background</h3>
        <p>
        I grew up in Gaithersburg, Maryland, which is a suburb north of Washington, DC. Here it is on a map. I went to local public schools, including Gaithersburg High School, which was recently renovated. I own a brick from the old Gaithersburg High School building.

        <h3>Academic interests</h3>
        <p> I am aspiring mathematician, *patiently* waiting for responses from PhD programs. My current research interests are in numerical analysis, although I love all kinds of mathematics and try to learn about and incorporate a broad range of mathematical ideas into my education and research. I'm especially interested in number theory, which is the study of the counting numbers 1, 2,..., and is one of the most fundamental areas of mathematical study. The unexpected patterns that continue to appear and confound in the study of numbers are fascinating to me.
        </p>
        <h3>Sports</h3>
        <p>
        At Gaithersburg High School, I played varsity baseball for 3 years in the fall, spring, and summer and swam in the winter. I also played varsity baseball and swam during my freshman year at Poolesville High School in Poolesville, Maryland. I continued to play baseball after high school at Montgomery College, the local junior college in Montgomery County, Maryland, and later at Kenyon College in Gambier, Ohio.<br><br>
            Sports continue to be an important part of my life. I like to lift weights during the (long) Alaskan winters, and I recently started cross-country skiing. For the past several summers, I have participated in a DC men's baseball league called DC Wood.
